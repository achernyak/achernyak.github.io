I have been interested in software development almost my entire life. The ability to make the computer do complex tasks for you seemed like magic to me, and sometimes still does. I deployed my first web page at 14 and I have been in love with development ever since.


The first language I formaly learned was [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29) and it was the reason why I got really interested in programming. Then, as life went on, the wonder of programming started to fade. Just as I was begining to feel drained, I rediscoverd functional programming. It clicked with me why I was feeling drained and what I've been missing.

Functional programming brought the magic back to my programs. It brought a whole new level of abstraction with it, making mundane things much quicker to accomplish and let me focus on the real interesting problems.

I have carried the concepts of functional programming with me throught a wide breadth of techologies, and this blog is for me to share my experiences.

## Day job ##
I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Ikayzo](http://www.ikayzo.com/). Where I get to work with a wide array of tools on variety of projects. The technologies with specialize in are:

* Ruby on Rails
* React
* Angular 1/2
* Java
* Android
* iOS

## Free time ##
Right now, I am doing a deep dive on common lisp and clojure. I've always been drawn by the power of macros, and I finally gave in. This takes up most of my time, but I manage to squeeze in work on my previous projects and even a few new once.

* Common Lisp
* Clojure
* ClojureScript
* Haskell
* Go
* C
* Python
* Raspberry Pi
