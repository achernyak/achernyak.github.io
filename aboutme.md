---

I am a huge proponent for functional programming and I have been able to use it across a breadth of technologies. I want to share my experiences, good or bad, with anyone that is interested in software development.

## Day job ##
I am a Prototype Software Engineer at Monsanto. This position entitles me to rapidly design full system prototypes, while implementing best of breed technologies and processes. I get to work with:

* Angular
* NodeJS
* Java
* Scala
* Python

## Free time ##
Right now, I am focused on mastering Haskell and it's become a small passion of mine. This takes up most of my time, but I manage to squeeze in work on my previous projects and even a few new once.

* Haskell
* Go
* ReactJS
* Ruby
* Raspberry Pi

<!-- I am also involved with the process of transitioning these prototypes to full fledge systems under an on going team. This involves training, introduction to tools, style guide construction, and best practice communication. -->
<!--
In my free time I have been working hard to learn Haskell and it has become a small passion of mine. I really enjoy the type system design and the language philosophy of composition as a whole. My advancements with Haskell have heavily influenced my style of development across the board. -->
