I have been interested in software development almost my entire life. The ability to make the computer do complex tasks for you seemed like magic to me, and sometimes still does. I deployed my first web page at 14 and I have been in love with development ever since.

With school and work, the wonder of development started to fade. Every task seemed like just busy work and there wasn't much exitement. Luckily, I soon discovered functional programming through a good friend of mine.

Functional programming brought the magic back to my programs. It brought a whole new level of abstraction with it, making mundane things much quicker to accomplish and let me focus on the real interesting problems.

I have carried the concepts of functional programming with me throught a wide breadth of techologies, and this blog is for me to share my experiences.

Right now, I am focused on mastering Haskell and it's become a small passion of mine. This takes up most of my time, but I manage to squeeze in work on my previous projects and even a few new once.
